# Links Panel
Links Panel, collecting all the links on a page

## What can it do
Grab all the links on the page and show them to you, like classic opera could.

## Links Appearance
The links will be styled similarly to how they appear on the page. You can change this in extension settings.

## Searching
You can filter the links. By default the panel will search through link title, url and display text.

It won't match case by default.

You can toggle this in extension settings.

## Adding as a web panel
In Vivaldi, you can add this as a web panel.

Turn on *Developer Mode* in the extensions page and get the ID of the extension.

Add `chrome-extension://eofhkahmgjlddedjnbjmndkgmiabhifi/panel.html` as a web panel, exchanging the long string for whatever the extension ended up installing as.
